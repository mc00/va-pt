This will serve as a port of the updater script from my va-pt kit to update some common tools on backtrack5

---- NOTE ----

To use the updater script, you must first run the installer script. This WILL remove those directories
within backtrack and install the most recent release of the applicable tool. If the tool is currently
supported via SVN or GIT, the most recent version will be checked out in place of the release in place
by backtrack.

If you do not want the current structure of BackTrack modified, do not run this updater tool.
