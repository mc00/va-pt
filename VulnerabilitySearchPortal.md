The Vulnerability Search Portal

# Introduction #

Currently the Vuln Portal will allow you to search for exploits installed onto the install from ExploitDB as well as vulnerability notices from NVD. OSVDB is currently not available as they are not making the DB dumps available. Once OSVDB corrects the issue, OSVDB will be integrated back into the portal.


# Details #

The portal installs into /var/www/search
